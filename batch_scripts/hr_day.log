distributed.scheduler.KilledWorker: Attempted to run task 'process_model-dd5005cd-8b5e-4346-9827-ec250668433e' on 4 different workers, but all those workers died while running it. The last worker that attempt to run the task was tcp://10.6.8.135:33611. Inspecting worker logs is often a good next step to diagnose what went wrong.
